    <p class="text">This is a list of the best-selling video games of all time. The best-selling video game to date is
        Minecraft, a sandbox video game originally released for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux in 2011. The game
        has been ported to a wide range of platforms, selling over 180 million copies</p>
    <p class="text">Of the top 50 best-selling video games on this list, over 20 were developed or published by
        Nintendo, including over half of the top ten. Four games were published by Nintendo and their affiliate, The
        Pokémon Company. Other publishers with multiple entries in the top 50 include Activision, Rockstar Games,
        Electronic Arts, and Sega. Aside from Nintendo's internal development teams, Game Freak is the developer with
        the most games in the top 50, with five from the Pokémon series. The oldest game in the top 50 is Frogger, which
        was released in June 1981. Games reported on by player count instead of official sales figures, such as
        registered accounts, subscriptions, or free-to-play ownership, are to be included on the list of most-played
        video games by player count instead.</p>
