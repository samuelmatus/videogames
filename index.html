            <h2>About Video Games</h2>
            <p class="text">A video game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface to
                generate visual feedback on a two- or three-dimensional video display device such as a touchscreen,
                virtual reality headset or monitor/TV set. Since the 1980s, video games have become an increasingly
                important part of the entertainment industry, and whether they are also a form of art is a matter of
                dispute.</p>
            <p class="text">The electronic systems used to play video games are called platforms. Video games are
                developed and released for one or several platforms and may not be available on others. Specialized
                platforms such as arcade games, which present the game in a large, typically coin-operated chassis, were
                common in the 1980s in video arcades, but declined in popularity as other, more affordable platforms
                became available. These include dedicated devices such as video game consoles, as well as
                general-purpose computers like a laptop, desktop or handheld computing devices.</p>
