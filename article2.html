<h1 id="title">Platforms</h1>
<div class="content">
    <p class="text">The term "platform" refers to the specific combination of electronic components or computer hardware
        which, in conjunction with software, allows a video game to operate.[24] The term "system" is also commonly
        used. The distinctions below are not always clear and there may be games that bridge one or more platforms. In
        addition to laptop/desktop computers and mobile devices, there are other devices which have the ability to play
        games but are not primarily video game machines, such as PDAs and graphing calculators.</p>
    <h2>PC</h2>
    <p class="text">In common use a "PC game" refers to a form of media that involves a player interacting with a
        personal computer connected to a video monitor.[25] Personal computers are not dedicated game platforms, so
        there may be differences running the same game on different hardware. Also, the openness allows some features to
        developers like reduced software cost,[26] increased flexibility, increased innovation, emulation, creation of
        modifications ("mods"), open hosting for online gaming (in which a person plays a video game with people who are
        in a different household) and others. A Gaming computer is a PC or laptop intended specifically for gaming.</p>
    <h2>Mobile</h2>
    <p class="text">With the advent of standard operating systems for mobile devices such as iOS and Android and devices
        with greater hardware performance, mobile gaming has become a significant platform. These games may utilize
        unique features of mobile devices that are not necessary present on other platforms, such as global positing
        information and camera devices to support augmented reality gameplay. Mobile games also led into the development
        of microtransactions as a valid revenue model for casual games.</p>
    <h2>Web browser</h2>
    <p class="text">The web browser has also established itself as platform in its own right in the 2000s, while
        providing a cross-platform environment for video games designed to be played on a wide spectrum of platforms. In
        turn, this has generated new terms to qualify classes of web browser-based games. These games may be identified
        based on the website that they appear, such as with "Miniclip" games. Others are named based on the programming
        platform used to develop them, such as Java and Flash games.</p>
